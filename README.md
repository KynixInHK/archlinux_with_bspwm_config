# archlinux_with_bspwm_config
The configuration files for my archlinux with bspwm.
## Introduction
Due to the redundancy of all kinds of desktop environments (DE) such as GNOME, Plasma, Buidge and other DEs, window manager might be a better way to use our Linux. When we install archlinux, we are absorbed by its flexbility and simpilicity. Image what will happen when you install a desktop environment for archlinux. There will be a lot of softwares that you don't want to use. So the archlinux will not be a pure archlinux. Isn't it? So let's turn to the bspwm. These are my own config files for archlinux with bspwm.
